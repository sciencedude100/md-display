# md-display
Really basic Markdown display site

## Story:
I needed a simple and easy way to display the beauty of markdown in a web browser. I had a folder of the files, and have the viewer dynamically allow the display of any of them. This project uses [BootMark](https://github.com/obedm503/bootmark) to make the markdown nice and pretty.

But, then I found [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), well so much for the time I spent!

I am leaving this here on GitHub in case anyone would like to add to it.

## Structure:
`file` is where the markdown files go
`index.php` is the control UI and iframe
`file.html` is the markdown loader and converter
